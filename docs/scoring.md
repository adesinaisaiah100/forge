# The Forge Scoring Engine
> *Why trusting the process matters more than trusting the bot.*

Most AI tools give you " vibes-based" feedback. You ask: *"Is this idea good?"* and they reply: *"This has potential! Here are 3 marketing tips..."*

That is **useless** for a founder. It feels good (dopamine), but it doesn't help you make a hard investment decision.

Forge is different. We built a **Expert-Orchestrated Evaluation Engine**. We don't ask the AI to "judge" you; we ask it to **measure** you against 6 critical dimensions, and then *we* apply the rigorous math of venture capital decision-making.

## 🏗 The Core Logic (How It Works)

Our scores are **Deterministic**. The AI provides the raw data, but our engine calculates the verdict. This prevents the "randomness" often seen in LLMs.

### 1. The Startup Dimensions (The Inputs)

We break every idea down into 6 weighted components. These weights reflect real-world startup failure modes.

| Dimension | Weight | Why It Matters |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Problem Strength** | **25%** | If the problem isn't painful, no one will pay. This is the foundation. |
| **Market Opportunity** | **20%** | Is the market big enough to support a business? Or is it a hobby? |
| **Differentiation** | **20%** | Can you defend this? Or will Google/Amazon kill you in a weekend? |
| **Timing Readiness** | **15%** | Why now? Are there tailwinds (e.g. AI adoption) or headwinds? |
| **Founder Leverage** | **15%** | Why *you*? Do you have unfair advantages (skills, network)? |
| **Execution Feasibility** | **15%** | How hard is this to actually build? (SaaS vs. Hardware). |

$$Score = \sum (ComponentScore \times Weight)$$

### 2. The Verdict Engine (The Decision Tree)

A high score isn't enough. We apply **"Kill Switches"** and **"Risk Adjustments"** to simulate a skeptical investor.

#### 🛑 Hard Kill Switches (Immediate Rejection)
*   **Problem Score < 40**: If the problem isn't real, the business is dead on arrival.
*   **Market Risk = "Critical"**: Fatal flaws like illegality, total monopoly lock-in, or dying industries.

#### 🚦 Decision Bands
*   **🟢 GO (Score ≥ 80)**: Exceptional. Consistent across all categories.
    *   *Downgrade Rule*: If **Differentiation < 55**, we downgrade to "REFINE". Good ideas with no moat are perfectly positioned to be stolen.
*   **🟡 REFINE (Score 60–79)**: The messy middle. Valid idea, but needs a pivot, better niche, or stronger angle.
*   **🔴 KILL (Score < 60)**: Fundamentally flawed. Save your time and money.

## 🧠 Confidence Scoring (Trust Metric)

We don't just tell you *if* the idea is good. We tell you **how confident** we are.

Confidence is calculated (0–100%) based on:
1.  **Input Completeness**: Did you write one sentence or a detailed plan?
2.  **Agent Agreement**: Did our 3 specialized AI agents agree? Or did the Market Expert fight with the Idea Expert? High conflict = Low confidence.
3.  **Clarity**: Was the AI able to clearly articulate the value proposition?

## 💎 Why This is Better for Founders

### 1. It’s Brutally Honest
LLMs are trained to be helpful and polite. They struggle to say "Your baby is ugly."
Our **Risk Profiler** is explicitly instructed to be "ruthless" and "don't sugarcoat." We force the model to identify why you might fail.

### 2. It’s Actionable
We don't just say "Improve marketing."
Because we score by dimension, we can say:
> *"Your Problem Score is 90 (Great!), but your Differentiation is 30 (Weak). Stop validating the problem and start building a moat."*

### 3. It Prevents "Solutionitis"
Founders love their solutions. We force you to score high on the **Problem** first. If the problem doesn't score, the solution is irrelevant.
